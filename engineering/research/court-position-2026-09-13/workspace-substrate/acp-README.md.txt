# Agent Coordination Protocol (ACP)

**ACP lets several autonomous coding agents share one repository without stepping
on each other.** It holds the durable facts that make cooperation safe — who is
working, what work exists, which files are claimed, what progress can be
recovered, and what still needs review — so independent agents coordinate through
shared _state_ instead of a shared conversation.

ACP says nothing about _how_ an agent thinks, edits files, or calls a model. It
only owns the workspace state that keeps parallel work from colliding.

## The problem it solves

Point two agents at the same repo and things break in predictable ways:

- **They collide.** Both edit `login.ts` at the same time and one silently
  clobbers the other.
- **A crash loses everything.** An agent dies mid-task and its progress —
  which lived only in its conversation — is gone.
- **Review is blind.** A human (or another agent) can't tell what an agent
  actually did, or whether it's safe to merge.

Conversational memory can't fix this: it doesn't survive a restart and can't be
shared between two different agents. ACP moves those facts _out_ of any single
agent into a durable, replayable log. Every change appends a monotonic event, so
a recovering worker can replay history and catch up before it acts.

## Core concepts at a glance

| Concept        | What it gives you                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Workspace**  | The shared context (a repo, worktree, directory, container, CI job).     |
| **Worker**     | A registered actor (agent, bot, human, CI) with an identity and status.  |
| **Work unit**  | A task with an explicit lifecycle state machine.                         |
| **Lease**      | An advisory, TTL'd claim on a resource (e.g. a file) — prevents clashes. |
| **Checkpoint** | A resumable snapshot of partial progress, so a handoff survives a crash. |
| **Memory**     | Append-only, workspace-scoped facts for handoff between actors.          |
| **Artifact**   | A preserved output (a PR, a diff, a file) tied to a work unit.           |
| **Review**     | A gate for human (or agent) decisions on a work unit.                    |
| **Event**      | The append-only, per-workspace history of everything above.              |

## How it works

ACP is a single long-lived **host process**. Clients never talk to each other;
they talk to the host, and the host owns the durable state. Every transport —
REST, native RPC, JSON-RPC, SSE — is served over the **same application
graph**, so a workspace created over REST is immediately visible to a
JSON-RPC client and streams to an SSE subscriber. There is one `Storage`
instance behind them all.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    C["Clients<br/>acp CLI · first-party TS · JSON-RPC / stdio"]
    C --> T["Transport<br/>REST · native RPC · JSON-RPC · SSE"]
    T --> AU["Auth + scope check"]
    AU --> D["Domain services<br/>work · lease · review · checkpoint · …"]
    D --> ST[("Storage port<br/>in-memory · SQLite · Postgres")]
    D --> EV["Event log<br/>one monotonic event per mutation"]
    EV --> ST
    EV --> BR["Event broker"] --> SUB["Live subscribers<br/>SSE · WebSocket"]
    ST -. "replay on recover" .-> D
```

A single mutation always takes the same path, whichever transport carries it:

1. **Authorize.** The transport resolves the actor and checks its scopes; a
   missing credential is `401`, an insufficient one is `403`.
2. **Apply.** A domain service validates the change against its invariants — a
   work-unit transition, a lease that isn't already held, a review gate that is
   green — and writes the new state through the `Storage` port.
3. **Record.** The same operation appends **exactly one** event to the
   workspace's strictly monotonic log (`workspace_id, seq`). State and history
   are written together, so they can never disagree.
4. **Fan out.** The event broker pushes the new event to any live SSE/WebSocket
   subscribers; durable replay stays backed by storage.

**Recovery is replay.** Because progress lives in the event log rather than any
agent's memory, a worker that crashes and restarts catches up by replaying
`events list --after <last_seq>` before it acts — no shared conversation, no lost
context. Storage (in-memory, SQLite, Postgres) and live fan-out (in-process,
`pg-notify`) are chosen at the host boundary behind ports, so the protocol
behaves identically from a laptop to a multi-replica deployment.

## Get started in 60 seconds

The fastest way to _use_ ACP is the Dockerized host plus the `acp` wrapper. One
command boots a persistent host with durable SQLite on a volume; a thin wrapper
runs the CLI inside it. No Node build, no token juggling.

```bash
# 1. Boot the host (builds the image on first run).
npm run acp:up            # == docker compose --profile sqlite up -d --build

# 2. Put the wrapper on your PATH so `acp ...` works from anywhere.
ln -s "$(pwd)/bin/acp" /usr/local/bin/acp
```

That's it — you now have a running coordination host. Everything you do with
`acp` executes inside the container against that host, and all state lives on a
named volume, so it survives restarts.

```bash
npm run acp:logs          # tail host logs
npm run acp:down          # stop (keeps your data)
docker compose down -v    # stop and wipe all state
```

> Requirements: Docker with Compose. The wrapper auto-detects the running host,
> refuses to run with a clear hint if none is up, and forwards `ACP_RPC_TOKEN`
> if you turn auth on.

Compose project names namespace containers, networks, and volumes; ACP does not
set daemon-global container names. Concurrent checkouts can therefore use
different `--project-name` / `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` values. Give each stack a
different published host port as well when running them simultaneously. The
`bin/acp` wrapper discovers the stable Compose service name, not a container
name; use the same `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` when invoking it for a named project.

## Your first coordinated task

This is the exact sequence a real worker follows — claim work, protect the file
it's about to edit, record recoverable progress, get reviewed, finish. It's the
same lifecycle the live-agent harness drives with fully autonomous agents.

```bash
# Create a workspace (kinds: git_repository, git_worktree, directory,
# container, cloud_sandbox, ci_job).
acp workspace create --name my-repo --kind git_repository \
  --uri "file:///path/to/repo" --default-branch main
# -> { "id": "workspace_...", ... }

# Open work in it.
acp work create "Fix login redirect" --workspace workspace_xxx --priority high
# -> { "id": "work_...", "state": "open", ... }

# Claim the work and lease the file you're about to touch.
acp work claim work_xxx --worker agent_codex
acp lease request --workspace workspace_xxx --holder agent_codex \
  --kind file --uri "file:///path/to/repo/src/login.ts" --ttl 300
#   -> a second worker requesting the same lease gets 409 lease_conflict.

# Go to work and record recoverable state as you go.
acp work update work_xxx --state running
acp checkpoint create --workspace workspace_xxx --work work_xxx \
  --summary "patched redirect target, tests green"
acp memory create --workspace workspace_xxx --work work_xxx \
  --kind handoff --key login-fix --summary "done" --content "notes for the reviewer"

# Register the output and ask for review (this performs running -> needs_review).
acp artifact pr --workspace workspace_xxx --work work_xxx \
  --url "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42" --summary "Fix login redirect"
acp review request --work work_xxx --by agent_codex

# A reviewer approves, then the worker finishes and releases the file.
acp review approve review_xxx --met "correctness"   # -> work goes to approved
acp work update work_xxx --state completed
acp lease release lease_xxx

# Replay the story at any time, usually as a bounded tail, or stream it live.
acp events list --workspace workspace_xxx --after 0 --limit 25
acp events stream --workspace workspace_xxx
```

Restart the host in the middle of all that and nothing is lost:

```bash
docker compose restart acp
acp work list --workspace workspace_xxx   # still there
```

## Run it directly (no Docker)

Prefer to run the host as a plain Node process? Build once and start it. This is
the same protocol behavior — Docker just packages it.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build                                   # tsc -> dist/

# In-memory storage, no auth — the simplest local path.
ACP_PORT=4317 node dist/app/server/main.js

# ...or durable SQLite:
ACP_STORAGE_ADAPTER=sqlite ACP_SQLITE_PATH=.acp/acp.sqlite \
  ACP_PORT=4317 node dist/app/server/main.js
```

The `acp` CLI is a thin HTTP client of the host. Point it with `ACP_BASE_URL`
(defaults to `http://localhost:$ACP_PORT`); every command prints JSON on stdout.
Here `acp` is shorthand for `node dist/app/cli/main.js`:

```bash
export ACP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4317
acp session init --worker agent_codex --name Codex --kind agent \
  --permissions workspace:read,workspace:write,work:create \
  --workspace workspace_primary
```

`session init` returns a `session_id` used as the bearer token once auth is on
and reports its `workspace_ids` binding when one was requested. Repeat
`--workspace` or provide comma-separated identifiers to bind more than one
workspace; omitting the flag creates an unbound session.

## Concepts in depth

### Work lifecycle

A work unit is a small state machine, and that machine is the contract every
transport enforces identically. The server rejects any jump the machine doesn't
allow with `invalid_state_transition` (HTTP 409), and every accepted transition
appends exactly one event to the workspace log — so the state a work unit is in
and the history of how it got there are the same fact, read two ways.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> open
    open --> claimed
    claimed --> running
    running --> needs_review
    running --> blocked
    blocked --> running
    needs_review --> approved
    needs_review --> changes_requested
    needs_review --> running
    changes_requested --> running
    approved --> completed
    needs_review --> rejected
    open --> cancelled
    claimed --> cancelled
    running --> cancelled
    completed --> [*]
    rejected --> [*]
    cancelled --> [*]
```

Read it in three parts:

- **The happy path** is `open → claimed → running → needs_review → approved →
completed`. A worker claims open work, starts it, submits it for review, and
  finishes once the gate is green.
- **The review loop** is what makes work correct rather than merely done. From
  `needs_review` a reviewer can `approve`, `reject` (terminal), or
  `request-changes` — which returns the unit to `changes_requested → running` so
  the worker writes a fresh checkpoint and resubmits. A worker can also pull work
  straight back to `running` to keep editing before any verdict lands.
  `blocked ⇄ running` is the same idea for a worker that hits an external
  dependency.
- **Terminal states** are `completed`, `rejected`, and `cancelled`. `cancelled`
  is reachable from any pre-review state to abandon work cleanly; nothing leaves
  a terminal state.

Each edge is a named event, which is what a recovering worker replays to
reconstruct where a unit stands:

| Transition                         | CLI / trigger                   | Event emitted              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `open → claimed`                   | `work claim`                    | `work.claimed`             |
| `claimed → running`                | `work update --state running`   | `work.started`             |
| `running → needs_review`           | `review request`                | `work.needs_review`        |
| `running → blocked`                | `work update --state blocked`   | `work.blocked`             |
| `blocked → running`                | `work update --state running`   | `work.unblocked`           |
| `needs_review → approved`          | `review approve`                | `review.approved`          |
| `needs_review → changes_requested` | `review request-changes`        | `review.changes_requested` |
| `needs_review → rejected`          | `review reject`                 | `review.rejected`          |
| `needs_review → running`           | `review cancel`                 | `work.resumed`             |
| `changes_requested → running`      | `work update --state running`   | `work.resumed`             |
| `approved → completed`             | `work update --state completed` | `work.completed`           |
| `* → cancelled`                    | `work update --state cancelled` | `work.cancelled`           |

### Leases

A lease is an **advisory** TTL'd claim on a resource identified by `kind` +
`uri`. Requesting one already held by another worker returns `409
lease_conflict`. Long work can `renew`; a supervisor can `revoke` a stale one;
`lease list` inspects workspace lease state. Leases coordinate — they do not lock
the filesystem.

### Reviews

A review gates a decision on a work unit. Cancellation is its own lifecycle
event (`review.cancelled`), distinct from rejection: cancelling a requested
review withdraws the gate and lets the work continue rather than failing it.

### The review gate

A review is more than approve/reject. A reviewer can anchor **diff-anchored
comments** to a file and line on an artifact and open a **grill** — a set of
forced senior-level questions the worker must answer. The gate passes only when
every blocker question is `accepted` and every review comment is `resolved`:

1. **Comment.** Reviewer: `review comment --review <id> --work <id> --workspace
<id> --artifact <id> --file <f> --side new --body "…"`. The worker addresses it
   and the reviewer runs `review comment resolve <comment_id>`.
2. **Grill.** Reviewer: `grill open …`, then `grill ask <grill_id> --severity
blocker --prompt "…"`. The worker answers with `grill answer <question_id>
--answer "…"`; the reviewer records `grill verdict <question_id> --accept`.
3. **Evaluate.** Reviewer: `grill evaluate <grill_id>` computes pass/fail —
   `passed` requires every blocker accepted and every comment resolved.
4. **Approve.** On a green gate, `review approve <id> --met <csv>`.

The `work resume <id>` packet carries `open_comments` and `latest_grill`, so a
returning reviewer sees outstanding gate obligations in a single read.

For accumulated work, `acp work resume <id> --budget <n>` returns a bounded
working set: `work`, `latest_checkpoint`, `open_comments`, and `latest_grill`
stay inline; the most-recent artifact metadata and reviews fill the requested
capacity; and older entries become `elided.artifacts` / `elided.reviews`
`{count, ids}` references. Approved reviews and the review tied to the latest
grill are pinned even if they exceed the budget, preserving the GitHub merge
gate. Omitting `--budget` returns the unchanged full packet.

The REST route also emits a stable `sha256` `ETag` for each full or budgeted
view. An HTTP client can send that value as `If-None-Match` on its next
`GET /v1/work/<id>/resume`; unchanged state returns `304` with an empty body,
while any change — including to an elided entity — invalidates the tag. The CLI
currently exposes the budget but leaves conditional revalidation to direct HTTP
clients.

### GitHub-driven workflow (optional)

`acp gh` binds the ACP review gate to a real GitHub pull request. It is a
CLI-only bridge over the `gh` CLI (using `gh`'s own auth — ACP never reads,
stores, or forwards a token); the protocol host has no GitHub dependency.

- `acp gh import <pr> --work <id> --workspace <id>` — pull the PR diff into a
  `diff` artifact and a `pull_request` artifact on the work.
- `acp gh sync <pr> --work <id> --review <id> --artifact <id>` — idempotent
  two-way reconcile of review comments between ACP and the PR (imports GitHub
  comments, posts ACP comments, propagates resolution). Safe to re-run.
- `acp gh merge <pr> --work <id> [--method squash|merge|rebase]` — post the ACP
  decision as a PR comment, then merge **only if** the gate is green (a review
  approved, the latest grill passed, no open comments). A blocked merge exits
  non-zero and never merges.

`<pr>` is a PR URL or `owner/repo#number`.

### Events

Every workspace has an append-only, strictly monotonic event log
(`workspace_id, seq`). It is the source of truth for ordering and the recovery
mechanism: a returning worker replays `events list --after <seq> --limit <n>`
before opening a live subscription, keeping context recovery proportional to the
tail it actually needs. Worker presence, by contrast, is host-scoped current
state (`worker list` / `worker get`), not derived from event history.

### Cost and budgets

ACP records raw token and compute quantities per work unit, prices them with
workspace policy, and rolls spend through the spawn graph. A budget on a parent
therefore bounds its entire subtree. Admission is checked when work is claimed,
enters `running`, or provisions a sandbox; already-running work is never killed
when later spend exhausts the limit.

Cost entries stay out of the coordination event log. Only budget decisions are
causal events:

| Event              | Meaning                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `budget.granted`   | A worker or ancestor budget was set.         |
| `budget.exhausted` | New execution was refused by a spent budget. |

Budget-specific protocol failures are:

| Error code         | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `budget_exhausted` | A budget on the target-to-root path has reached its limit.   |
| `unpriced_model`   | A report names an unpriced model while a budget is in force. |

The REST surface is `POST/GET /v1/work/:work_id/cost`,
`PUT /v1/work/:work_id/budget`, and
`PUT /v1/workspaces/:workspace_id/prices`. Attested reports require a signed
`cost.report` assertion; sandbox lifetime entries are metered by ACP.

---

## Transports

Every transport runs against the **same** application graph, so sessions,
workspaces, leases, events, memory, checkpoints, artifacts, and reviews are
shared no matter how a client connects.

| Transport           | Endpoint / entry           | Use it for                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **REST**            | `/v1/...`                  | The primary HTTP surface; what the CLI speaks.      |
| **SSE**             | `GET /v1/events/stream`    | Workspace-scoped live events over HTTP.             |
| **Native RPC**      | `/rpc/native` (NDJSON)     | First-party TypeScript clients using `@effect/rpc`. |
| **JSON-RPC (POST)** | `POST /rpc`                | Compatibility; 2.0 envelopes, batch, notifications. |
| **JSON-RPC (WS)**   | `GET /rpc` (upgrade)       | The same JSON-RPC surface over a persistent socket. |
| **stdio bridge**    | `acp-jsonrpc-stdio` binary | Content-Length framed JSON-RPC for stdio clients.   |

**Native RPC** is the recommended path for new first-party TypeScript consumers:
one NDJSON path serves both unary calls and `events.subscribe` streaming, and
every operation carries structured Effect telemetry (operation, outcome,
duration, client id, ACP error code). **JSON-RPC** is the compatibility surface —
every REST mutation has a paired method — not the focus of new client work.

### API description (OpenAPI)

The REST surface is published as a machine-readable
[`openapi.json`](./openapi.json) at the repo root, generated from the same typed
route definitions the host serves. The running host also serves it live and
unauthenticated at `GET /openapi.json`, so a client can fetch the contract before
any session exists. Point an OpenAPI generator at either to produce a client in
any language, or load it into Swagger UI / Postman to browse every endpoint
before adopting ACP. `info.version` tracks the protocol version, so the document
moves only when the wire contract does. Protected operations declare the
`AcpSession` HTTP bearer scheme; only `session.initializeSession` is public, so
generated clients expose the credential flow used by the production router. It
is regenerated with
`pnpm openapi:generate` and gated byte-for-byte against the contract by
`pnpm check:openapi`, so the committed file can never drift from the code. See
[`wiki/references/openapi.md`](./wiki/references/openapi.md).

---

## Deploying for real

The host is a single long-lived process, so it runs on any **persistent
container platform** (Railway, Fly.io, Render, a VM, Kubernetes) — not
serverless. Two unauthenticated probes report health before any session exists:

| Probe         | Endpoint      | Meaning                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Liveness**  | `GET /health` | `200` while the process serves; makes no backend calls.              |
| **Readiness** | `GET /ready`  | `200` when storage answers, `503` when it is unreachable (drain it). |

Point your platform's health check at `/ready`. The multi-stage
[`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) builds a non-root image whose `HEALTHCHECK` already
targets it.

### Metrics (`GET /metrics`)

The structured telemetry every native-RPC and HTTP call already emits (operation,
outcome, duration, error code) is also exported in **Prometheus text format** at
`GET /metrics`, alongside counters for what the background retention sweeper
evicts. Unlike the health probes, this endpoint is **off by default**: set
`ACP_METRICS_TOKEN` to both enable it and gate it behind a bearer credential —
unset, it answers `404`; set, a scrape must present
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` (Prometheus's `authorization` scrape option) or
it answers `401`. Point Prometheus at it once the token is configured:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: acp
    authorization:
      credentials: <ACP_METRICS_TOKEN>
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['acp-host:4317']
```

The exposed series are a scrape **contract** — see
[`wiki/references/metrics.md`](./wiki/references/metrics.md) for the full list and
what is worth alerting on (RPC error rate, request-duration histograms, and event
pruning falling to zero).

### Scale out: the `ha` Compose profile

When one node isn't enough, the **`ha` profile** boots the ADR-0008
`self-host-ha` stack — Postgres storage plus `pg-notify` cross-replica event
fan-out — ready to scale to multiple hosts:

```bash
npm run acp:ha:up      # docker compose --profile ha up -d --build (Postgres + host)
acp work create ...    # ./bin/acp auto-detects the acp-ha host service
npm run acp:ha:down
```

Run one profile at a time (both publish `4317`). The
[`docker.yml`](./.github/workflows/docker.yml) CI workflow guards both paths on
every PR — it runs the Docker-hosted CLI dogfood and drives the Postgres profile
through the same coordination lifecycle a real multi-agent deployment uses. The
same image runs every profile; only environment differs. See
[`wiki/references/deployment.md`](./wiki/references/deployment.md) for the
platform-by-platform runbook.

### Optional edge proxy (Traefik)

Front the ACP host with a free, clone-and-go reverse proxy:

```bash
npm run acp:edge:up        # sqlite base + Traefik edge
# or: npm run acp:ha:edge:up

# through the proxy (self-signed TLS):
curl -k -H 'Host: acp.localhost' https://127.0.0.1/ready
```

Traefik serves `https://acp.localhost` (self-signed cert), a dashboard on
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`, and load-balances across HA replicas
(`docker compose --profile ha --profile edge up --scale acp-ha=3`). The first HA
replica keeps raw host port `4317` for `./bin/acp`; scaled replicas receive the
next available ports in `4318`–`4326`, while Traefik reaches every replica on
its internal `4317` endpoint. The unauthenticated dashboard is loopback-only;
production deployments must secure or disable it. Traefik has no daemon-socket
mount: it discovers backends through a pinned read-only socket proxy on an
internal control network. Only version, ping, event, container, and network
reads are enabled. The proxy still owns the privileged socket mount, so this
narrows the trust boundary rather than making Docker daemon access harmless.

The edge runtime is supported and tested with these exact multi-architecture
release tags:

| Component           | Supported image                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Traefik             | `traefik:v3.7.7`                              |
| Docker socket proxy | `ghcr.io/tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy:0.1.1` |

Dependabot checks Traefik monthly. Socket-proxy updates are manual because its
Git releases can lead its public GHCR tags: an upstream release alone is not a
deployable image. Before changing that pin, confirm the exact candidate manifest
exists in GHCR for both AMD64 and ARM64, then update this table and run the
complete Docker self-dogfood gate. Every edge update must keep an exact release
tag; do not substitute `latest`, a floating major/minor tag, or an
architecture-specific digest. The aggregate self-dogfood runs the pin/update
policy guard before building, then proves both SQLite and HA edge profiles.

**Opt-in basic-auth** (demo): generate a hash and attach the middleware —
`htpasswd -nbB acp acp` → add an `acp-auth` `basicAuth` middleware to
`traefik/dynamic.yml` and append `acp-auth@file` to the router's
`traefik.http.routers.acp.middlewares` label.

### Storage adapters

Storage is selected at the host boundary behind a single port, so persistence is
an adapter concern, not a protocol concern.

- **In-memory** (default) — deterministic, ephemeral. Good for the local happy
  path and tests.
- **SQLite** (`ACP_STORAGE_ADAPTER=sqlite`, `ACP_SQLITE_PATH=...`) — durable
  state and an append-only event table, created on startup.
- **Postgres** (`ACP_STORAGE_ADAPTER=postgres`, `ACP_DATABASE_URL=...`) — the
  network-durable adapter (via `@effect/sql-pg`, pooled, migrations on startup)
  for multi-replica hosting. Per-workspace event `seq` is allocated atomically,
  so concurrent writers across processes never collide; the host fails fast at
  boot if `ACP_DATABASE_URL` is unset.

Live event fan-out is chosen separately: `ACP_EVENT_BROKER=in-process` (default)
is the single-node broker; `ACP_EVENT_BROKER=pg-notify` delivers SSE/WebSocket
notifications across replicas while replay stays backed by durable storage.

### Operations

Three contracts govern running a store safely over time; they are tested, not
just documented — see the
[operational contracts](wiki/references/operational-contracts.md) reference and
[ADR-0020](wiki/decisions/ADR-0020-operational-contracts.md). Workers see the
agent-facing side of these guarantees (replay cursor, fail-closed boot, restore
recovery) in [`ACP-SKILL.md`](ACP-SKILL.md).

- **Event retention & replay** — the background sweeper prunes events older than
  `ACP_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS` (delete-based, no compaction; `<= 0` disables it).
  `seq` is monotonic and never reused, a workspace's newest event is never
  pruned, and a cursor older than the prune horizon resumes at the oldest
  retained event instead of erroring.
- **Protocol-version upgrades** — the store stamps its protocol version once in
  `store_meta/protocol_version`. A boot guard proceeds only when that stamp is in
  `SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS` and otherwise **fails closed** — ACP will not
  serve against a store it cannot interpret. There is no automatic cross-version
  data migration; a bump requires an explicit migration or a fresh store.
- **Backup & restore** — SQLite via the SQLite backup API (a consistent
  point-in-time copy even under writes; a raw file copy can tear); Postgres via
  `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` (online-consistent). A restore returns the store to a
  consistent point. The Docker self-dogfood exercises both round-trips.

### Authentication and scopes

Local mode allows unauthenticated requests. Set `ACP_REQUIRE_AUTH=true` to
require bearer sessions on scoped routes. For an exposed host, also select the
trusted issuance boundary documented in
[trusted session issuance](wiki/references/trusted-session-issuance.md).

- `ACP_SESSION_ISSUER=trusted-client` keeps `session.initialize` caller-derived
  for controlled local/self-host use.
- `ACP_SESSION_ISSUER=static` verifies a service credential and replaces the
  requested worker, permissions, capabilities, and workspace bindings with one
  server-policy grant. The hosted profile selects this fail-closed mode.
- Session ids are opaque, high-entropy credentials (not counters or timestamps).
- Permissions are explicit strings — `work:create`, `lease:create`,
  `review:approve`, `event:read`, and so on.
- Missing/invalid credentials return `401`; a valid token lacking the required
  scope returns `403` with the `forbidden` error code.

The CLI and stdio bridge forward `ACP_RPC_TOKEN`. In static mode it carries the
issuance secret for `session init`; replace it with the returned `session_id`
for later calls. ACP policy stores only the secret's SHA-256 digest.

## Configuration

`.env.example` is the drift-checked runtime manifest for the host, CLI, stdio
bridge, and scripts. Copy it for local use; inject secrets from the operator
shell rather than committing them.

`<pr>` is a PR URL or `owner/repo#number`. The `gh` bridge requires the `gh` CLI
installed and authenticated (it uses `gh`'s own auth — ACP never handles a token).

## Testing and dogfooding

The verification path is TypeScript typechecking, ESLint, and the full Vitest
suite:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

### `acp bump` version planning

`pnpm bump` manages two independent lines: release semver in `package.json` is
inferred from full conventional-commit evidence, while the two-part ACP protocol
version changes only through an explicit `--protocol` decision. The policy and
failure contract are defined by
[ADR-0016](wiki/decisions/ADR-0016-version-bump-policy.md).

```bash
pnpm bump --baseline --dry-run # preview the first annotated release baseline
pnpm bump --baseline --yes     # create it after explicit confirmation
pnpm bump --dry-run            # inspect the proposal without writes
pnpm bump --yes                # apply the inferred release proposal
pnpm bump --protocol major --yes
pnpm bump --release patch --force --yes
```

Apply refuses dirty trees, invalid or contradictory flags, missing baselines,
and non-interactive execution without `--yes`. It validates every target before
a rollback-capable multi-file transaction. The tool never tags uncommitted bump
edits; after the resulting diff is reviewed and committed, run the post-commit
tag command printed in its output.

`tsconfig.json` owns full-source typechecking and test discovery.
`tsconfig.build.json` is the production-emission boundary: `pnpm build` cleans
`dist`, excludes test-only TypeScript, and fails if a test or fixture module is
still emitted. The Docker builder copies both configurations and runs that same
checked production build.

Production images use msgpackr's supported pure-JavaScript decoder path.
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` declines only the optional `msgpackr-extract` install
script, while the runtime sets `MSGPACKR_NATIVE_ACCELERATION_DISABLED=true`.
The addon accelerates string decoding but is not required for transport
correctness; native Effect RPC remains covered by the Docker self-dogfood gate.

Beyond unit tests, several lanes exercise ACP against a _live_ host:

- **`pnpm quickstart`** — builds the ordinary production image and runs the
  short developer story: two workers race one file lease, the loser receives
  HTTP `409 lease_conflict`, the SQLite-backed host restarts after a nonzero
  cursor and durable handoff, the winner replays only the later event tail, and
  review approval gates lease release and completion. The aggregate Docker
  self-dogfood gate runs this same scenario against its reused image.
- **`pnpm dogfood:docker-self`** — builds the production image once. It
  first validates edge runtime policy and agent-facing permission examples,
  then exercises every local domain and transport through the compiled public
  entry points,
  restarts the SQLite container to prove named-volume durability, verifies
  bearer permissions and workspace binding, then restarts the same durable host
  under static issuance. The static phase rejects missing/wrong and WebSocket
  query credentials, replaces hostile grants across CLI, JSON-RPC HTTP/stdio/
  WebSocket, and native RPC, authorizes subscriptions before acknowledgement,
  revokes an old session after policy revision, rejects historical worker
  remapping, and audits without secrets. It then reuses the image for the HA and
  edge gates. The production-image scenario also proves that a budgeted
  resume bounds inline artifacts and reports the remainder as references. The
  authenticated GitHub bridge remains an explicit opt-in sandbox lane.
- **`node scripts/acp-docker-cli-dogfood.mjs`** (`dogfood:docker-cli`) — builds
  the production image, runs ACP as a container, and drives the compiled CLI
  inside it through a full workspace/work/review lifecycle, verifying the
  replayed event types. This is the proof the daily-driver image is real.
- **`node scripts/acp-docker-ha-dogfood.mjs`** (`dogfood:docker-ha`) — runs the
  Compose `ha` profile with separate planner, worker, and reviewer identities,
  forces claim and lease races, proves Postgres event fan-out across two host
  replicas, verifies the sweeper emits exactly one lease-expiry event, restarts
  the hosts mid-lifecycle, and replays the monotonic event history.
- **`node scripts/acp-docker-edge-smoke.mjs`** (`dogfood:docker-edge`) — fronts
  both the SQLite and two-replica HA profiles with Traefik, then verifies
  HTTP/HTTPS routing, security headers, dashboard health, and exact backend
  discovery.
- **`scripts/live-test/`** — evidence contracts for operator-driven real-agent
  audits: genuinely autonomous agents
  (planner / two workers / reviewer), each given only a role and the `acp` CLI,
  coordinate through a live SQLite-backed, auth-on host. A verifier then asserts
  six invariants — monotonic event seq, real lease contention, a
  request-changes→approve loop, terminal states with no dangling leases,
  cross-actor handoff, and API↔SQLite durability parity.

The package also exposes an `acp-jsonrpc-stdio` binary that reads Content-Length
framed JSON-RPC from stdin, forwards it to the host's `POST /rpc`, and writes
framed responses to stdout.
